### Laser Tag Championship
Laser Tag has been out for over 3 months, and for the last 2 months, we've been inviting YouTubers, organizing the Laser Tag Championship and editing the video.

### %#FFFFFF%You%#%%#FF5555%Tube%#% Edition
We invited a bunch of YouTubers to compete against each other in our brand new gamemode. Each YouTuber invited their best friend to play along with them and provide the necessary support. 
Huge thanks to ItzOwo, Sharpness, RelatedNoobs, privqted, Haider Playz, Dimension Thunder, Vaes, Flxme, LukeUCraft and TooBad for joining the event.
